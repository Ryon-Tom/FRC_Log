# FRC_Log
App Script For FRC Google Sheet

Use a form with:
Timestamp	| Name |	Category of work (Pick All) |	What you did (1-3 sentences) | Email Address

Then call that tab RESPONSES

Then make a new tab called AnalysisOfInformation

Then just make sure that all the info from the first tab is moved there

Then that should be enough

idk tho
